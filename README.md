# CMPSC 481 - Module 1

* Point value: 250 pts. (25% of course grade)
* Assigned: 13 February 2020
* Due: Various (see below)

## Objective

For your group to learn how to choose and contribute to an open source project using development and deployment best practices.

## Goals

* To choose an appropriate project to contribute code and documentation to
* To develop high-quality software in response to a community need
* To practice various skills which may or may not be directly code development

## Good sources for finding projects

Ideally, your team might consider continuing your contributions to the same project chosen in Module 1. However, if deciding to find new projects, the same resources may be helpful:

* [MunGell's "Awesome for Beginners" Repository](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners)
* [Up For Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/)
* [GitHub Help Wanted](http://github-help-wanted.com/)
* [First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

## Before contributing

The following sources provide good guides to the methods and standards of community contribution:

* [Getting Involved with Open Source Projects](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/getting-involved-open-source-projects)
* [How to Contribute to Open Source Projects](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

| 12 March 2020   | End of Module Survey  | A survey of individual comments, to be shared with the group|

### Progress report (`progress.md`)

This report must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] At least 500 words
- [ ] Completed using proper document structure in Markdown
- [ ] Includes a link to the open issue thread which the team is tackling
- [ ] Includes a `Personnel` section, listing the members of your group and roles they play for the module
- [ ] Includes a `Summary` section, summarizing the project and issue selected
- [ ] Includes a `Tasks` section featuring sub-sections for each role's completed and outstanding tasks
- [ ] Includes a `Progress` section which estimates feasibility of achieving deadline and provides a general discussion of module progress and challenges
- [ ] At least one paragraph for each of the `Summary`, `Tasks`, and `Progress` sections

### Final Technical Report (`FTR.md`)

This report must meet the following criteria:

- [ ] At least 1000 words
- [ ] Completed using proper document structure in Markdown
- [ ] Includes a link to the Pull Request made
- [ ] Includes a `Personnel` section, listing the members of your group and roles they play for the module
- [ ] Includes a `Summary` section, summarizing the project and issue selected, including a technical description of moderate depth
- [ ] Includes an `Evaluation` section, summarizing the overall success of the project
- [ ] Includes a `Testing` section which describes how the group tested their contribution
- [ ] Includes a `Post Mortem` section in which the team reflects on process improvements or repeatable successes to take forward from the module
- [ ] At least one paragraph for each of the `Summary`, `Tasks`, and `Evaluation`, `Testing`, and `Post Mortem` sections

## Evaluation

The points you earn for each module come from a combination of:

* Issuance of a Pull Request (or similar) for a feature of non-trivial complexity
* The quality of your group's in-process and final documentation
* The overall quality of your interaction with and contribution to your chosen project
* Comments from peers and external reviewers using feedback forms

## Turning in the assignment

### Writing

All reports should be turned in using Markdown files extant in the `writing` directory of this repository. As stipulated in the Syllabus [in the course-materials repository](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-481-spring-2020/course-materials), the writer should spearhead the effort. However, this does not mean that they alone should complete it. These reports require input and contribution from the entire group.

### Surveys

This survey will be distributed to you via our course's [Slack channel](http://cmpsc-481-sp-2020.slack.com) as we near the end of the module.
